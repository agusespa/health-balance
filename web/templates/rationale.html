                                health reserve starts low in youth but compounds

                                Structural metrics like
                                <strong>VO2 Max</strong> and
                                <strong>WHtR</strong> act as a mathematical
                                "floor." Because these biomarkers are slow to
                                change, they provide a weighted anchor that
                                protects your score from wild fluctuations based
                                on a single poor week.

                                This ensures your score remains grounded in
                                actual physical capacity, even as it tracks
                                daily habits. For a 40-year-old, the persistent
                                ~3.8 point weekly tax (per 1,000) creates a
                                headwind that requires consistent performance to
                                overcome.
