                        The system is built on the interaction between two

                                ensures that the "cost" of maintaining your
                                health reserve starts low in youth but compounds
                                significantly as you age.

                                annual decay rate at age 40, requiring higher
                                consistency to stay level as you move into
                                mid-life.

                                Structural metrics like
                                <strong>VO2 Max</strong> and
                                <strong>WHtR</strong> act as a mathematical
                                "floor." Because these biomarkers are slow to
                                change, they provide a weighted anchor that
                                protects your score from wild fluctuations based
                                on a single poor week.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This ensures your score remains grounded in
                                actual physical capacity, even as it tracks
                                daily habits. For a 40-year-old, the persistent
                                ~3.8 point weekly tax (per 1,000) creates a
                                headwind that requires consistent performance to
                                overcome, ensuring your reserve is earned
                                through discipline rather than luck.
